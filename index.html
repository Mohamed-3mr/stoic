            <p class="stoic-mean">Stoicism is a philosophical school of thought that originated in ancient Greece and was later developed by Roman philosophers. It teaches that the path to happiness and fulfillment lies in accepting and embracing the natural order of the universe, regardless of external circumstances.
                Stoics believe that the key to a good life is living in accordance with reason and virtue, and that individuals should focus on developing inner strength and moral character. They advocate for self-control, discipline, and the cultivation of wisdom. Stoicism places emphasis on the distinction between things that are within our control (our thoughts, actions, and attitudes) and those that are outside of our control (external events, other people's actions).
                Central to Stoic teachings is the idea of practicing "apathy," which does not mean indifference or lack of emotion, but rather maintaining inner calm and tranquility in the face of life's challenges. Stoics encourage individuals to detach themselves from their desires and attachments to external outcomes, recognizing that true happiness comes from within and is not dependent on external circumstances.
                Prominent Stoic philosophers include Zeno of Citium, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius. Stoicism continues to be studied and practiced by individuals seeking to cultivate resilience, inner peace, and a meaningful life.
